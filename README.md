# Movie Expert using Clean Architecture together with MVVM

This **Movie Expert** is built using Clean Architecture and MVVM together.
The main idea for such approach is using Clean approach as the main structure and MVVM only for UI part of it.


For more details on MVVM architecture, please refer to Android's official [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)
